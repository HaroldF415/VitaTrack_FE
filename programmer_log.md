# Programmer's Log

Using this markdown file to keep track of how I'm building this project. Combining everything that I've learned inside of class with my instructors, outside of class with my classmates, and on my own to build this project.

## Why [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)?

Recently the React.js documentation has been updated and the `create-react-app` command is no longer recommended. Instead, the React team recommends using `Next.js`, `Remix`, `Gatsby` or `Expo`. However I shared a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/89NJdbYTgJ8) to my classmates some time ago about how `Vite` is a faster alternative to `create-react-app` and I've been wanting to try it out for a while now. So I decided to use `Vite` for this project.

The reason I choose `Vite` was to challenge myself to learn something new. Out of all the choices explained above and with my time constraints I believe `Vite` to be the safest choice to challenge myself with it.

Without going to much into depth on why `Vite` this article explains why `Vite` is a good choice for React.js projects:

## About `VitaTrack`

`VitaTrack` is more than just a blood sugar tracker - it's a full-fledged platform designed to support and motivate individuals in their journey to manage conditions like diabetes effectively.

My mission with `VitaTrack` is to make managing blood sugar levels simpler, friendlier, and more interactive. Being diagnosed with diabetes myself at the young age of 18 has given me a unique perspective on the challenges of managing this chronic condition. Everytime I try to stay healthy it feels like a chore or an invasion on my personal life. With this web app, I hope to change that and make managing diabetes a seamless part of everyday life.

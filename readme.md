## About `VitaTrack`

VitaTrack is more than just a blood sugar tracker - it's a full-fledged platform designed to support and motivate individuals in their journey to manage conditions like diabetes effectively.

My mission with VitaTrack is to make managing blood sugar levels simpler, friendlier, and more interactive. Being diagnosed with diabetes myself at the young age of 18 has given me a unique perspective on the challenges of managing this chronic condition. Everytime I try to stay healthy it feels like a chore or an invasion on my personal life. With this web app, I hope to change that and make managing diabetes a seamless part of everyday life.
